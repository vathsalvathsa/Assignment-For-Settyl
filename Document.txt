Below is the documentation covering the entire development process, including data preprocessing steps, model architecture, training procedure, API implementation, and testing results.

Development Process Documentation

1. Data Preprocessing Steps
Data Collection: Data was collected from a suitable source containing external status descriptions and corresponding internal status labels.
Data Cleaning: The data was cleaned to remove any irrelevant or duplicate entries.
Data Preprocessing: Text data preprocessing techniques were applied, including lowercasing, tokenization, removal of punctuation, and removal of stop words if necessary.
Data Encoding: The target labels were encoded if they were categorical using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

2. Model Architecture
Model Selection: A suitable machine learning or deep learning model was selected based on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the data.
Model Architecture Design: The model architecture was designed, specifying the number and types of layers, activation functions, and any other relevant parameters.
Model Compilation: The model was compiled with an appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.

3. Training Procedure
Data Splitting: The preprocessed data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Training: The model was trained on the training data using appropriate training techniques, such as batch training or online training.
Model Evaluation: The model was evaluated on the testing data to assess its performance using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters were tuned if necessary to optimize the model's performance.

4. API Implementation
Framework Selection: FastAPI framework was chosen for implementing the API due to its simplicity, speed, and integration with Python types.
API Endpoint Design: An API endpoint was designed to accept external status descriptions as input and return predicted internal status labels.
Model Integration: The trained model was integrated into the API to make predictions based on the input received from the endpoint.
Error Handling: Error handling mechanisms were implemented to handle invalid input data or any unexpected errors gracefully.
API Documentation: Documentation for the API, including endpoint descriptions, request/response formats, and usage examples, was prepared.

5. Testing Results
Unit Testing: Unit tests were conducted to verify the correctness of individual components such as data preprocessing functions, model architecture, and API endpoints.
Integration Testing: Integration tests were performed to ensure that all components work together as expected.
Performance Testing: Performance tests were carried out to measure the API's response time and throughput under various load conditions.
Validation Testing: Validation tests were conducted to validate the accuracy of predictions made by the API against a separate validation dataset or manually verified data.
